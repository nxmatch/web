_"When is the next match?"_
======

[That's the question to answer][0], this is the main repository for the NxMatch website that will satisfy that need for information.

There is not much just yet, bt we'll be changing that. 


To get started you might want to setup [git][1], install [go][2] and [start][3] [hacking][4].

Oh, if go is not your thing, you can also tell us here what do we need to work with it.
