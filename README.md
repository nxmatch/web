_"When is the next match?"_
======

[That's the question to answer][0], this is the main repository for the NxMatch website that will satisfy that need for information.

There is not much just yet, but we'll be changing that. 


To get started you might want to setup [git][1], install [go][2] and [start][3] [hacking][4] either from the command line with any text editor or using [IntellJ Idea][5] with the [Go plugin][6].

Oh, if go is not your thing, you can also [tell us][7] here what do we need to work with it.

Current project directory:

- /app Go source code for the website
- /static Static resources such as javascript files, css, images, etc.
- /templates Source template files used by go source code to generate text dinamically
